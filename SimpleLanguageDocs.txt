                happens. everything after sometimes happens
        number foo = 0
        loop {
            print("ALWAYS HAPPENS")
            
            foo == 0 {
                stop 2
            }
            
            // doesnt always happen
            foo = foo - 1
        }
        
        
Control Flow
    1) stop <int> | it stops reading code intill you get the int value amount 
                more } than {
        stop 4
        
if and else if and else
    1) value == value { | if checks to see if 2 value equal
        foo == bar {
    2) else if only goes through if the if before doesnt and the if does work
                    else is everything at the end
        loop {
            foo == bar {
                print("if) foo equals bar")
                stop 2
            }
            foo == bar + 1 {
                print("else if) foo == bar + 1")
                stop 2
            }
            print("else) foo doesnt equal bar")
            stop 1
        }

Operands
    1) + | adds the left and right or concanates them if its text
    2) - | subtracts the rigth value from the left
    3) * | multiplys the left and right value
    4) / | divides the right value from the left
    5) ^ | it multiplies the left value by itself the right value amount of times
    6) % | it returns the remainde of the left value divided by the right value
    
    newValue = leftValue <op> rightValue
